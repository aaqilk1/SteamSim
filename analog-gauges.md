# Analog Gauges

A number of the instruments on the panel are actually analog meters that are current driven.

- Fuel Gauge
- RPM Gauge
- Manifold Pressure Gauge

Here is the RPM gauge, that I removed for testing as I refined the arduino code:

This section will go over how these can be wired up and driven by Arduino PWM pins
