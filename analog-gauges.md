# Analog Gauges

A number of the instruments on the panel are actually analog meters that are current driven. 

These include: 
- Airspeed
- Vertical Speed
- Turn Coordinator
- Slip Coordinator
- Fuel Gauge
- RPM Gauge
- Manifold Pressure Gauge

This section will go over how these can be wired up and driven by Arduino PWM pins
